# Railway-Management-System
This repository contains the source code of Railway Management System.
Railway Management System is an initiative to make the ticket booking and journey process from home itself.
In this project I have used Python as a language and MySQL as the database server, both, the Python files and the SQL server are linked to each other using MySQL Connector for Python.

**Pre-Requisites for this project to rum on your local system**
1. You must have the latest version of python installed on your system.
2. You must have installed:-
        a) MySQL Shell.
        b) MySQL Workbench.
        c) MySQL Server.
3. First of all you should create a database named "railway_reservation" on your SQL server
4. On the second line of source code you should write the user and the password for acessing the database server.

Copy the source code into your code editor and the run the program.
During the runtime it will ask for your preference and inputs.
On giving the suitable input the program will execute further depending upon your input.

This was a jist about my project, I hope you will like it.
Happy Coding :)
